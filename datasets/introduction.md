- Longitudinal CT images, HNSCC patients

##### Purpose

- To visualize <u>anatomical changes</u> in <u>HNSCC</u> patients throughout radiotherapy <u>(RT) treatment course</u>

##### Acquisition and validation methods

- CT images from <u>31</u> patients
- <u>Three</u> CT scans acquired throughout the duration of the radiation treatment course
  - <u>Pretreatment planning</u> CT scans with a median of <u>13 days before treatment</u>
  - <u>Mid-treatment</u> CT at <u>22 days after start of treatment</u>
  - Post-treatment CT <u>65 days after start of treatment</u>
- Patients received RT treatment to a <u>total dose of 58-70 Gy</u>, using <u>daily 2.0-2.20 Gy</u>, fractions for <u>30-35</u> fractions
- Besides the imaging data, <u>contours</u> of anatomical structures for RT, <u>demographic</u>, and <u>outcome measurements</u>

##### Data format and usage notes

- DICOM files including images
- RTSTRUCT files and RTDOSE files can be found here [TCIA](http://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/)
- CT taken during pretreatment, mid-treatment, and post-treatment <u>(HNSCC-3DCT-RT)</u>

##### Discussion

- Quantitative imaging assessment
- Investigation on anatomical changes with treatment progress
- Dosimetry of target volumes
- normal structures

#### A longitudinal 4D CT and cone beam CT dataset for image-guided RT research in lung cancer

The only problem is that it is a bit large for me to download, with over 180 GB.
